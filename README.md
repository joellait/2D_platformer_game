## 2D Platformer Game

This project is a 2D platformer game, made originally in 2020 with Python and PyQt5, and been updated to PyQt6 in 2023. The player character of the game is my favourite animalâ€“a penguin (which also represents my appreciation for Linux!). The goal of the game is to move it with arrow keys and reach the green platform. There are three levels to game. If you fall down from a platform, you will have to restart your game. 

The game starts by executing main.py file. Make sure that you have PyQt6 installed to your computer. It can be installed through pip, with the command pip install PyQt6.

Hope you enjoy the game! I had the best time coding it.
