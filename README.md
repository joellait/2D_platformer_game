This project is a 2D platformer game, made in 2020 with Python and PyQt5, and updated to PyQt6 in 2023. The player character of the game is my favourite animalâ€“a penguin (which also represents my appreciation for Linux). The goal of the game is to move the penguin with arrow keys to reach the green platform. There are three levels to game. If you fall down from a platform, you will have to start from the beginning. The game is higly inspired by old school Super Mario games, albeit with simpler graphics, levels, and storyline.

The game starts by executing main.py file. Ensure that you have downloaded all the necessary files and have PyQt6 installed on your computer. You can install PyQt6 in the terminal using the command: pip install PyQt6.

Hope you enjoy the game! My personal goal coding the game was to learn how to create a GUI using PyQt, and learn more about game programming. I learnt a lot, and most importantly, had the best time.

Special thanks to my dear friend Sofi Meronen for creating the music tracks and effects to the game. All other media used in the game is copyright-free.
