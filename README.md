This project is a 2D platformer game, made in 2020 with Python and PyQt5, and updated to PyQt6 in 2023. The player character of the game is my favourite animalâ€“a penguin (which also represents my appreciation for Linux). The goal of the game is to move the penguin with arrow keys to reach the green platform. There are three levels to game. If you fall down from a platform, you will have to start from the beginning. The game is higly inspired by old school Super Mario games, however with less rigorous graphics, levels, and storyline.

The game starts by executing main.py file. Make sure that you have all the files downloaded as well as PyQt6 installed to your computer. It can be installed with the command pip install PyQt6.

Hope you enjoy the game! My personal goal coding the game was to learn how to create a GUI using PyQT, and learn more about game programming. I had the best time learning coding through it.

Special thanks to my dear friend Sofi Meronen for creating the music tracks and effects to the game. All other media used in the game is copyright-free.
